Week 1: The Science Behind Images

Week 1 covered the fundamentals of digital image processing and how images are represented using pixels and intensity functions. Different image types such as binary, grayscale, and color images were studied along with color models like RGB, CMYK, and HSI. Core image-processing operations were introduced, including acquisition, enhancement, restoration, segmentation, and object recognition. Traditional techniques such as Gaussian filtering, morphological operations, Fourier and wavelet transforms were discussed, along with the basics of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis.

Week 2: Getting Started with Neural Networks

Week 2 was about understanding how neural networks work and how they learn from data. Videos helped develop intuition about concepts like backpropagation and how models improve through training. CNNs were introduced as special networks for image data, especially useful in medical imaging for detecting diseases from scans. Hands-on tasks included basic image processing in Python and exploring medical datasets to observe classes, imbalance, and common challenges.

Week 3: CNNs, Darknet, and YOLO

Week 3 focused on moving from basic neural networks to advanced CNN architectures used in real computer vision applications. Darknet and ImageNet were explored to understand how large datasets and efficient frameworks helped build modern vision models. YOLO and the Ultralytics ecosystem were introduced for real-time object detection, along with hands-on work such as exploring datasets on Roboflow and training a classification model.

Week 4: TILs and TIGER Grand Challenge

Week 4 covered the TIGER challenge and the use of AI for automated assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer histopathology images. The clinical importance of TILs as prognostic and predictive biomarkers was emphasized, especially in HER2-positive and Triple Negative breast cancers. Key tasks included immune cell detection, tissue segmentation, and automated TIL scoring. This week demonstrated the practical application of computer vision and deep learning in medical diagnosis.
